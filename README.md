# MOVIE CATALOG APP

* Keep track of all the movies you've ever watched in your life ever

* See your movies listed alphabetically and chronologically

* Uses OMDB api for movie data

----
Incomplete:

- Sign up and log in are just dummy stuff for now until I get proper authentication. Also, these will not be in a separate view.

- There is no validation for adding a new movie (you can add something that does not exist, or add a movie twice, and it will mess with the lists)

- No error messages yet for getting movies, login, or signup

----
Features coming soon:

* Enter the date when you watched the movie, and list movies according to watch date

* Give your movies a rating out of 5 stars

* Add reviews / comments to your movies so you can remember what you were thinking at the time
