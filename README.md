### Built with
	* Node and Express
	* Mongo db, and Mongoose for ODM
	* EJS server-side rendering
	* OMDB api for movie data

----
### Main things to implement:

* Validation for checking if a movie already exists before add

* If movie is not found on OMDB, provide a form to add a movie manually
 * Use default poster for this until I validate the poster size 

* Remove unwanted dates

* Format alphabetical column display
 * Make pleasant and grid-like for large datasets 
 * Movies beginning with 'The' shouldn't be under 'T'
 * Movies beginning with numbers should come last

* Import movies using JSON text

----
### Features coming:

* Add reviews / comments to your movies so you can remember what you were thinking at the time

* List movies by rating only (currently they are listed by rating within each chronological year)

* Try out some kinda resizing / zoom on the data sets

* Eventually make the landing page something other than signup / login.

----
### Bugs / Gremlins / Errors:

* None right now
