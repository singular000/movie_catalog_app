# MOVIE CATALOG APP

[**USE THE APP HERE - Movie Catalog App hosted on Heroku**](https://movie-catalog-app.herokuapp.com)

* Keep track of all the movies you've ever watched in your life ever

* See your movies listed alphabetically and chronologically


### Built with
	* Node and Express
	* Mongo db, and Mongoose for ODM
	* EJS server-side rendering
	* OMDB api for movie data

----
### Main code to implement:

- Removing user ids from the url now that sessions are implemented (full routing refactor)

- Validation for checking if a movie already exists before add

- If movie is not found on OMDB, provide a form to add a movie manually

- Removing an added movie

- Make landing page the movie search page (instead of signup) now that sessions are implemented

- Uh, hashed passwords . . . yeah. Should have done it already

----
### Features coming soon:

* Enter the date when you watched the movie, and list movies according to watch date

* Add reviews / comments to your movies so you can remember what you were thinking at the time

* List movies by rating (currently they are listed by rating within each chronological year)

* Request for a movie brings back all related movies, so that you don't get stuck with the 2014 version of RoboCop

----
### Bugs / Gremlins / Errors:

* none reported yet
