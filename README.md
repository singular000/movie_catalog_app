# MOVIE CATALOG APP

[**USE THE APP HERE - Movie Catalog App hosted on Heroku**](https://movie-catalog-app.herokuapp.com)

* Keep track of all the movies you've ever watched in your life ever

* See your movies listed alphabetically and chronologically


### Built with
	* Node and Express
	* Mongo db, and Mongoose for ODM
	* EJS server-side rendering
	* OMDB api for movie data

----
### Main code to implement:

- Validation for checking if a movie already exists before add

- If movie is not found on OMDB, provide a form to add a movie manually

- Removing an added movie

- Eventually make the landing page something other than signup / login.

- Formatting the chronological movie list view with tabs for flipping between years, to facilitate larger data sets

----
### Features coming soon:

* List movies according to watch date (but watch dates do now exist)

* Remove unwanted dates

* Add reviews / comments to your movies so you can remember what you were thinking at the time

* List movies by rating only (currently they are listed by rating within each chronological year)

* Try out some kinda resizing / zoom on the data sets

----
### Bugs / Gremlins / Errors:

* None right now
